      <p> Evan Brisbin is a Junior undergraduate computer science student studying at St. Cloud State University with a passion for problem-solving and coding.
        Evan is currently diving deep into mastering data structures and alogrithims and computer architecture, while also working on building portfolio projects such as a blog app and a personal finance app. When Evan is not            studying you will most likely find him playing video games or watching a movie. When Evan gets more experience in his life, his plan is to pursue a career in video game development.
